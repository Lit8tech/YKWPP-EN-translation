## How do I Install This??

For Android, installing the mod is a matter of uninstalling Puni from your phone and grabbing the [latest modded apk from our site](https://www.punitranslation.com/downloads/android).

The iOS version is still in beta, and only works with jailbroken devices at the moment. Grab the latest beta version from the [iOS section of our site](https://www.punitranslation.com/downloads/ios).


# How to NOT lose your acccount when installing the Android version

### the android verison wipes all data from the application, so you just need to be connected to your L5ID on your vanilla game and reconnect to it once the mod is installed. When updating the mod, the app data will not be wiped, so this is only for first time users.


# FaQ:

What other languages are you translating into?:

The languages we are translating into are
English, French, German, Spanish and a demo of a Chinese version. But after English translation is fully done we will also do Russian and Ukrainian. 
But right now we are practically only focusing on English, we just have people already translating bits and pieces in the other languages, but since there is no known dump of the other languages download files as of know, so even when we start fully working on those translations, it will take way longer to complete than the English one.
