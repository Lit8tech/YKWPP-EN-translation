## How do I Install The translation?

### For iOS
**# Download Instructions
### Note: the mod is iOS only and will stay this way**
### Note: Before doing any of this you need to make sure you have Puni installed and the data download downloaded. If you do not know how to get Puni, I recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ubJk8XewFw)

Find a way how to sideload an ipa onto your device, I recommend [Sidestore](https://sidestore.io/#get-started), but any sideloading tool should work

Sideload PureKFD, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Lrdsnow/PureKFD/releases)

Inside PureKFD, go into the settings and change the exploit to whatever one suits your device (Direct Write for Jailbroken and Trollstore, MDC for 15.0 to 16.1 one, KFD for 16.1 to 16.6 beta 1, and Sparerestore for all other versions up to 18.1 beta 4)
(if using Sparserestore, you need to input your pairing file and enable Wireguard vpn, find details on that also [here](https://sidestore.io/#get-started), look at sections 3 and 4, after you get your pairing file press select file and select the file in the settings pane of PureKFD. Also make sure to disable filter tweaks.)

Open PureKFD, then go into the browse tab, then click on the plus in the top right corner.

Into the Add Repo box simply copy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lit8tech/yOS-PureKFD-Repo/refs/heads/main/purekfd.json

Then press on the yOS Yo-kai Watch Mod Repo and select Yo-kai Watch Puni Puni: English Translation! (Images 1/2) and Yo-kai Watch Puni Puni: English Translation! (Images 2/2) for translated images and Yo-kai Watch Puni Puni: English Translation! (Extras) for Strings, Cuds and the Videos.

Then go into the installed tab and and click install tweaks.

Once installing is done for all of them, click apply, as mentioned earlier, make sure wireguard vpn is on if your using sparserestore and make sure you don't have sidestore open. If your using Sparerestore and the app crashes when applying, install and apply all three tweaks individually.

Once it says tweaks have been successfully applied you can press reboot and everything will be done! Puni will be translated

### For Android
Currently there is no version for Android, but a cool team is working on reviving Yo-kai Watch Wibble Wobble on Android, so if you interested please join their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/r4B4WVyBJU)
